# Warhammer Rules Library

A local-first Warhammer 40,000 rules reference with Core Rules, Army Books, Mega Glossary and roster-specific guides.

## Books

- Core Rules Reference
- Death Guard
- Adeptus Mechanicus
- Tyranids
- T'au Empire
- Chaos Space Marines
- Orks
- Emperor's Children
- Space Marines
- Dark Angels (with the Space Marines dependency)

Books can be listed as `PREVIEW`, `FUNCTIONAL` or `PUBLICATION-READY`. Preview readiness covers the usable reader and build; optional roster and Compatible Rules support is evaluated only when advertised. Publication readiness remains a separate source-authority decision.

## Verification

```powershell
npm.cmd test
```

`npm test` runs the normal Preview gate: generated freshness, basic rule data, shared integration and fatal runtime contracts.

Run the extended source, parity, publication and browser checks separately:

```powershell
npm.cmd run test:full
```

`test:full` is not required for ordinary Preview development.

To verify the external source snapshots as well:

1. Install Node.js and Python 3.
2. Install `requirements-army-books.txt`.
3. Clone `https://github.com/BSData/wh40k-11e` at the commit recorded in each `bsdata-extract.config.json` into `tmp/bsdata-wh40k-11e`.
4. Run `npm.cmd run army-books:sources:check`.

The committed generated output does not require Python to view or test. Python is needed only to reproduce PDF extraction and the Space Marines merged BSData layer.

For ordinary local viewing, serve the repository over HTTP. PWA installation and offline caching do not work from `file://`.
